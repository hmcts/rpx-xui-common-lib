<p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-compliant for the following reasons.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="Non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations">Non-compliance with the accessibility
  regulations</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">Some pages cannot be navigated completely using just a keyboard, so some people won’t be able to
  tab through the pages. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1 (keyboard accessible).</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Some pages can’t be listened to in full using a screen reader, so some people won’t be able to
  access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.2.5 (audio description – prerecorded).</p>

<p class="govuk-body">Some of the contrast ratios don’t meet the current accessibility requirements. This fails WCAG 2.1
  success criterion 1.4.3 (contrast – minimum).</p>
